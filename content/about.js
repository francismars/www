  title: "About Me",
  content: `Hi, I'm <strong>Francis</strong>, a software engineer passionate about building <strong>practical tools with real-world impact</strong>. My projects, like <strong>Chain Duel</strong>, a Lightning-powered videogame, and <strong>PubPay</strong>, a simple way to split payments or receive donations via Nostr, explore the intersection of <strong>technology and decentralized money</strong>. I focus on creating projects that are not only useful, but also open-source and accessible to the wider community.<br>

Beyond code, I contribute directly to <strong>Bitcoin adoption and education</strong>. You'll often find me traveling to conferences and communities around the world, bringing a positive energy to Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr education. Whether it's on stage, at the arcade machine, or in casual conversations, I help make complex ideas tangible and exciting. I see myself not only as a <strong>builder</strong>, but as an <strong>ambassador of permissionless tech</strong>, showing that Bitcoin can be powerful, practical, and fun.`
